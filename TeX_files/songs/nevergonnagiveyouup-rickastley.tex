	\songsection{Verse 2}
	We've known each other for so long
	Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it
	Inside, we both know what's been going on
	We know the game, and we're gonna play it
	
	\songsection{Pre-Chorus}
	And if you ask me how I'm feeling
	Don't tell me you're too blind to see
