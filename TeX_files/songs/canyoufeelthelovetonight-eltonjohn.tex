	[\E]There's [\Fsharp]a [\G]calm [\A]sur[\G]ren[\D]der [\E]to [\Fsharp]the [\G]rush [\A]of [\G]day.
	[\E]When [\Fsharp]the [\G]heat [\A]of [\A]a [\G]rol[\D]ling [\B]wind [\C]can [\B]be [\A]turned [\B]a[\A]way

	\songsection{Verse 2}
	There's a time for everyone if they only learn
	That the twistin' kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
	There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
	When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours
	
	\songsection{Chorus} \songsnippet{And can you feel the love tonight? ...}
	
	\songsection{Outro}
	It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
	Believe the very best
